# Functions of hypercerts

## 1. Identifiability
Hypercerts clearly define the work that is supposed to be impactful by creating a record of who (set of contributors) claims to do or have done what (scope of work) in what time period (time of work). They also allow the creation of multiple records of the same work to identify separate impacts that this work had or will have (scope of impact) over specified time periods (time of impact).

## 2. Traceability
As these records are public and logically monotonic (immutable, except to split or merge hypercerts), records are durable and permanent.

## 3. Transferability
The records are a digital object that can be owned and ownership can be transferred (under specific conditions). As hypercerts can be created as fractionalizable, it is also possible to transfer only a specified fraction of the hypercert. Each hypercert defines the rights over the defined work that owners have, such as rights to retrospective rewards, rights to public display of the support (“bragging rights”) or rights to passive income from intellectual property.

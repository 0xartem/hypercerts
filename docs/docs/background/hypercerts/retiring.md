# Retiring hypercerts
While a claim in the impact space can not be unclaimed, it can be retired. Retiring a hypercert means that owners can not transfer and sell it anymore. This way owners prove that they are the final buyers of the impact. Technically retiring hypercerts means that they are sent to a specific null address, which ensures that the retired hypercerts are recorded and traceable.

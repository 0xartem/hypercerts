# Emerging ontologies

Common ontologies for the scope of work and scope of impact are useful to create transparency and improve discoverability. Such ontologies need to be created from the practices and should be adapted over time. They are like emerging norms, instead of fixed rules. However, some larger players or a group of smaller players could enforce certain ontologies, e.g. if multiple funders agree that they only fund projects that follow a specified ontology.

As some ontologies might be more useful than others, we would ideally see a consensus emerge between participants and experts in each impact area. Decentralized governance institutions can help facilitate this; however, further details on the design are out of the scope of this paper and are left for future work.
